[Setup]
The software is written in matlab and runs stably on MATLAB 2017b. 
The project calls the static encoder of HM11 in the Windows environment.
Therefore, it cannot be run directly on Linux.

[Overview]
This software will eventually output the compression coded results of the Stanford Crystal dataset with different PSNR requirements.

[Notice]
1.Demo.m is the entrance of the project.
2.Make sure the "~/ANT_SFFT" folder and its subfolders are all in the MATLAB working path.
3.Please note that the running time may exceed 5 hours. Please ensure that there is more than 10G space under the project running path.
4.The folder named 'crystal' contains the light field test data set of the Stanford Crystal.
5.The folder named 'sfft_crystal' contains the SFFT reconstruction result of the alogrithm propoed by [1].
The software of [1] can be downloaded from https://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/LFSparseRecon/#code.
In the project we have used it to process the dataset in advance. So this project can run completely independently.
The other tested data set can be downloaded from http://lightfield.stanford.edu/lfs.html.

[Expected Output]
For each value of required PSNR, it will generate 4 folders. E.g. if the PSNR value is 27.0027, then we will get '27.0027', '27.0027_box', '27.0027_rec', '27.0027_sub'.
1.The folder 'PSNRvalue' is the data generated during the processing, regardless of the result.
2.The folder 'PSNRvalue_box' is the low-frequency light ield data generated by channel 1, and the 'str2.bin' in it is the H.265-encoded stream file.
3.The folder 'PSNRvalue_sub' is the high-frequency light ield data generated by channel 2, and the 'str2.bin' in it is the H.265-encoded stream file.
4.The folder 'PSNRvalue_rec' is the result of the decompression.
